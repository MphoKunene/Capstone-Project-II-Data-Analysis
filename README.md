# Capstone-Project-II-Data-Analysis

The purpose of the project:
Is to understand the basics of what data looks like and the kind of question our data might answer. We clean, analaze and explore our data.

Data being analyzed is the automobile which is categorized in whether the car is a standard or a turbo.

How the data is being analysed:
 - by cleaning the data to check if there is any missing values in the dataset as well as handling those missing data whether to delete the column or the row, or just leaving it be.
 - we also created the visualization extracting stories and creating assumptions based on that data

The main findings are:
  - The visualization showed that there was a lot of Toyota make than any other care with 32 models made while the least is a mercury make with only 1 model meaning it might just be last in the making.
  - people buy more cars between average risk and a lot riskier. While only a few buy cars that are less risky which is between -2 and -1
